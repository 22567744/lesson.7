		Nowadays, with the change in habits, the decrease of the population and
	  the competition of supermarkets, the market has shrunk in size.
	  Fish stands are now only under the porches of the “Pescaria”, while the
	  fruit & vegetables can be found just outside them.Even though
	  the size of the Market has decreased, the beauty of it, the quality
	  of the offering, the variety and the atmosphere are well worth a visit,
	  some photos, and possible the purchase of some amazing locally produced delicacies!

			A man, big smile on his face, cuts a bit off the end of the sausage
		  and leans over his stall to hand it to me. He gestures encouragingly
		  for me to grab it and taste it – so, of course, I do just that.
			Chorsu bazaar, Tashkents best-known market, is impressive both
		  inside and out. Like a Pantheon for vegetables, its enormos
		  aquamarine carapace sets the stage for the daily bustle
		  of thousands of shoppers looking for the freshest ingredients.

			Grand Central Market is the epicenter of the high-low
			culture that Los Angeles pulls off so well. The cheaper
		  takeaway spots—the tacos and sandwiches—are just as good
		  as the more ballyhooed counters. It just depends on what
		  you're in the mood for. Villa Morelianas carnitas tacos are
		  as perfect Michoacan cuisine as you can find, while Belcampo
		  Meat Co. serve up a classy burger with dry-aged beef, white cheddar,
		  and caramelized onions on a brioche bun. Perfect. The oriental
		  problem is: there might be too many good options.
		 </div>
		 <img src="img/35128e_b9c14c84fc087cedef27ab32b0479b9e.webp" alt="Market">
		  On counters of this oriental Bazaar you will find fresh fruits,
		  amber-colored dried fruits, toasted bread, fresh-killed meat
		  kazy, and what not… And all these things are so attractive that
		  one can’t stand to pass by them. Next to bazaar there are
		  choykhonas, where you can taste amber yellow pilaf, fragrand
		  shashlyk, hot shurpa. Refreshing yourself you can go to handicraft
		  shops, where masters of applied art sell hand-made souvenirs.

				Chorsu Bazaar is, in a few different ways,a great<br>
			  way to see a local side of Tashkent –and Uzbekistan<br>
		  – more generally.You see it in the things that are<br>
		    for saleThe enormous tables with the trays of dates,<br>
				other dried fruit, nuts, and candy are emblematic of <br>
				this part of Central Asia.Whenever you go to someone’s<br>
			  house or a formal gathering there will be plates on offer 
				with these selections.

			But when you come here you are reminded that this has been
		  the land of traders for centuries. It’s no surprise to see
		  this mix of traditional local wares with the imported stock
		  from around Asia.That’s how it’s always been.And this, ultimately,
		  is why I love visiting bazaars in Central Asia so much. They are as
		  modern as they need to be, they are as local as they should be, but
		  the legacy of this region’s history is entwined within all of it.

				Or Tor Kor is so much more than a local market. It was once<br>
			  ranked the 4th best fresh market in the world by a famous
			  travel guide. Products displayed here are selected from
			  the best produce found in the entire country. With such
			  an incredible range of beautiful fruits, extremely fresh
			  vegetables, meats and seafood, Or Tor Kor should be on the
			  'must-see' lists of any chef or budding Gordon Ramsey.
			  You can find it right next to Bangkok's famous Chatuchak Weekend Market.

			While in the rest of the world, markets are being protected
		  for their unique ability to spark urban revitalization, foster
		  community diversity and improve public health, in Tashkent, markets
		  still have to defend themselves against a government that finds
		  them dirty and unsightly for tourists.Some have died, but others
		  have proved resilient: Chorsu, Yangiabad, Alay, Farkhad, Kuylyuk,
		  Mirabad and Hippodrome bazaars are the biggest ones remaining.

				Bazaar is the heart of every oriental city, the center of
			  public life,breadwinner of the whole city. Since the dawn
			  of time bazaars appeared on the intersections of trade
			  roads, on big squares of cities. They played roleof main
			  places of the city, where merchants, traders and common
			  people gathered to discuss important news, to know prices,
			  to have a rest in cozy eating pilaf and drinking green tea.
			  Also bazaars were the places of main entertaining events of
			  the city – theatrical performances.

			<img src="img/mercati-di-rialto-venice.jpg" alt="Shop">
			Tashkent Bazaar Chorsu, the age of which is more than
		  hundred years, also was always located on the main
		  square of the city Eski-Juva. Old bazaar constructions
		  destroyed and went bad, but the traditional architecture
		  remained unchanged – domed large premises. This was the
		  only way to protect oneself from heat and dust in
			terms of hot and dry Asian climate.

		<div class="list-container">
		Bread,dairy products and rice are offered in
	  caleidoscopic variety. Hawkers of colourful spices,
	  nuts and dried fruits are the big charmers in the
	  bazaar: watch out, they know how to sell. The
	  selection of vegetables on Chorsu remains limited
	  in range, stillreflecting Uzbek nomadic heritage.
	  Compare the relative leguminous quiet to the busy
	  exchange over at the meat pavillion.

		<div class="jad">
			The grand dame of Turkey’s shopping options, and
		  the most obvious starting point for those looking
		  to burn through some Turkish lira, the Grand Bazaar
		  dates to the 15th century and its majestic covered
		  lanes boast more than 4,000 shops. While shopping
		  for carpets, coffee sets, jewellery, traditional
		  handicrafts and much, much more is de rigueur,
		  the real pleasure comes from simply strolling
		  around and soaking up the history of this magnificent space.

		Hundreds of stalls, colours and fresh products. The noise of
	  conversations and the interior full of architectural gems.
	  The historic Market Hall at ul. Piaskowa has retained its
	  charm for more than 100 years. Now, apart from local customers,
	  it attracts increasingly often crowds of tourists. We managed
	  to take a look at it from the backyard.

			Today, it is a shopping centre not only for the Old Town citizens,
		  but for everyone, including professors, nuns and priests from Ostrów
		  Tumski. Many owners of the restaurants buy their products here. Market
		  Hall belongs to the tourist trail and is visited by 30-35 groups a day.

		The two towers in ul. Świętego Ducha hark back to the building of Arsenal.
	  The authors of the building were Richard Plüddemann and Heinrich Küster.
	  Plüddemann, the then city councillor for building, also designed Zwierzyniecki
	  Bridge, the building of University Library in ul. Szajnochy, the building of
	  Faculty of Architecture, he was also the author of the concept of Grunwaldzki
	  Bridge. Küster is thought to invent the idea of using reinforced concrete
	  to build the Hall, which was then an innovative solution.
